Fractions are a way of expressing part of a whole. They are written in the form of a/b, where a is the numerator (the number on top) and b is the denominator (the number on the bottom). The numerator represents the number of parts of the whole, and the denominator represents the total number of parts in the whole. For example, 3/4 means three out of four parts, or three-fourths. Fractions can be used to represent any part of a whole, such as one-third, two-fifths, or seven-eighths. Fractions can also be used to represent ratios or parts of a group. Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided, just like any other number. Fractions can also be converted to decimals or percents.
