Place value and number sense are two concepts that are closely related to each other. Place value is the concept of understanding the value of a digit in a number based on its position. For example, the number 456 has 4 hundreds, 5 tens, and 6 ones. This means that the 4 is worth 400, the 5 is worth 50, and the 6 is worth 6. Place value is important because it helps us to understand the value of a number and to compare numbers.

Number sense is the ability to understand numbers and how they relate to each other. It includes understanding the concept of place value, as well as being able to use numbers to solve problems. Number sense also includes being able to recognize patterns, identify relationships between numbers, and use mental math strategies to solve problems. Number sense helps us to better understand and work with numbers, and it is an important part of math.
