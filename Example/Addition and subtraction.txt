Addition and subtraction are two basic operations in mathematics. Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers together to create a sum, while subtraction is the process of taking away one number from another to find the difference. Both operations are used to solve mathematical problems and are the foundation of more complex calculations.

Addition is typically done by starting at the right-hand side of the numbers and working left. Starting with the right-most digit, the numbers are added together. If the sum of the digits is greater than 10, the tens digit is carried over to the left-hand side and added to the next column. This process continues until all of the digits have been added together.

Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Starting from the right-hand side, the numbers are subtracted from each other. If the number being subtracted is larger than the number it is being subtracted from, the tens digit is borrowed from the left-hand side and subtracted from the next column. This process continues until all of the digits have been subtracted from each other.

Addition and subtraction are essential operations in mathematics, and are used to solve a wide variety of problems. From basic arithmetic to more complex equations, these two operations are the foundation of mathematics.
