Multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves multiplying two or more numbers together to get a product. It is the opposite of division, which involves dividing a number into smaller parts. Multiplication is often used to calculate the total amount of something when there are multiple quantities involved. For example, if you were buying 3 apples for $2 each, you would multiply 3 x $2 to get the total cost of $6.

Division is the opposite of multiplication and involves dividing a number into smaller parts. It is used to find out how many times one number is contained in another. For example, if you had 8 apples and wanted to divide them equally among 4 people, you would divide 8 by 4 to get 2, meaning each person would get 2 apples.
