Title: Introduction to Addition

Grade level: 1st grade

Objective: Students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of addition and its properties by solving addition problems with single\ndigit numbers.

Materials:

Whiteboard and markers
Addition flashcards or printed addition worksheets
Counting manipulatives (such as colored blocks or cubes)
Chart paper or poster board for recording addition facts
Introduction (5 minutes):

Begin the lesson by reviewing the concept of counting and basic number recognition with the students. Then, explain that we can use counting to help us solve addition problems. Define addition as the process of combining two or more numbers to find a total.

Instruction (20 minutes):

Model addition with manipulatives: Begin by demonstrating addition using manipulatives. For example, place two groups of counters in front of the class and combine them to find the total. Ask students to count the total number of counters and repeat the process with different combinations of numbers.

Use addition flashcards or worksheets: Pass out addition flashcards or printed worksheets to students and have them work in pairs to solve the problems. As they solve the problems, encourage students to use manipulatives to help them visualize the addition process.

Record addition facts: Write addition facts on chart paper or a poster board as students solve the problems. Discuss the commutative property of addition (the order of the numbers does not affect the sum) and the associative property of addition (the grouping of the numbers does not affect the sum).

Practice (15 minutes):

Have students work independently or in pairs to solve additional addition problems using manipulatives and worksheets.

Assessment (10 minutes):

Assess student understanding by having them complete a simple worksheet with addition problems. Check their answers to see if they are able to solve the problems correctly and demonstrate an understanding of the properties of addition.

Conclusion (5 minutes):

Review the key concepts of the lesson, including addition as the process of combining two or more numbers, the commutative and associative properties of addition, and the use of manipulatives to visualize addition problems.
